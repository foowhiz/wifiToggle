# wifiToggle
To assign this script as a keyboard shortcut, go to settings > keyboard > shorcuts > custom shortcuts
Click on the + icon, then in the command field in the dialog box that pops up, type the following:

`/PATH/TO/THE/SCRIPT/wifiToggle.sh`

where /PATH/TO/THE/SCRIPT is the path to wherever the script has been downloaded (duh).
Note: Do not use path with ~ for home, as that is not identified here. Use the full path (/home/username/...)
Assign a name and keyboard shortcut of your choice, and you're done.
